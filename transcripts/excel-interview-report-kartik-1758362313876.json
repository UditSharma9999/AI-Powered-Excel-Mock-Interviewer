      "feedback": "The response 'I don't know this question' indicates a significant gap in knowledge regarding PivotTables, a fundamental tool in Excel.  While honesty is important,  demonstrating problem-solving skills, even if a solution isn't fully formed, is crucial in an interview context.  Try to approach problems methodically, even if you're uncertain.  Mentioning what you *do* know about PivotTables, even if it's limited, would have been more beneficial.",
      "suggestions": "Review the fundamentals of PivotTables in Excel. Practice creating PivotTables from sample datasets. Focus on understanding the purpose of rows, columns, and values fields.  Try working through some online tutorials or practice exercises.  Familiarize yourself with common scenarios where PivotTables are used for data analysis.",

      "feedback": "The response is far too brief and lacks the necessary detail to demonstrate understanding of conditional formatting.  It only mentions the tool, not how to apply it to solve the problem.  To be helpful, the answer needed to explain the steps involved in creating a conditional formatting rule, including selecting the cells, choosing the 'Highlight Cells Rules' option, and specifying the date criteria.",
      "suggestions": "To improve, focus on providing a step-by-step explanation.  Imagine you're explaining it to someone with basic Excel knowledge.  Include the specific conditional formatting rule you'd use (e.g., 'Less Than' or 'Date is before'), and mention how to select the relevant cells and format them appropriately.  Consider showing examples or screenshots in a real interview setting.",
      "strengths": "The candidate correctly identified conditional formatting as the appropriate tool. That's a positive start.",
      "areas_for_improvement": "The candidate needs to demonstrate a much deeper understanding of conditional formatting.

      "feedback": "The response correctly identifies VLOOKUP as a potential solution, but it's far too superficial.  It lacks crucial details about the implementation, such as specifying the lookup column, the return column, and the range.  The explanation of how to perform the multiplication to get the total cost is also missing.  The phrasing 'we look' isn't professional or clear.",
      "suggestions": "To improve, the candidate should provide a step-by-step explanation of how to use VLOOKUP (or INDEX/MATCH) in this scenario. This includes specifying the ranges, lookup values, and return columns. They should also explain how to incorporate the quantity column from the orders sheet into the calculation.  Consider using concrete examples with sample data to illustrate the process.",
      "strengths": "The candidate correctly identified VLOOKUP as a relevant function. ",
      "areas_for_improvement": "The candidate needs to demonstrate a much deeper understanding of how to apply VLOOKUP or INDEX/MATCH in a practical scenario.

      "feedback": "The response demonstrates a very limited understanding of how to implement data validation for email addresses in Excel.  The terminology is inaccurate ('dataalization' instead of 'validation'), and the proposed formula is far too simplistic and wouldn't reliably check for valid email formats. There's also a misunderstanding of how custom data validation works; simply checking for the presence of '@' is insufficient.",
      "suggestions": "I would suggest reviewing the Excel documentation on data validation.  Focus on understanding how to use custom formulas effectively within data validation.  Practice creating data validation rules with various criteria, including text-based validation.  Consider researching regular expressions (regex) as a powerful tool for validating email addresses, though this is an advanced topic.  Work on improving clarity and precision in your explanations.  It's important to clearly and accurately explain each step in a process.",
      "strengths": "The candidate seemed to grasp the general concept of data validation and its purpose. They attempted to describe the steps involved, although these steps were significantly flawed.",
      "areas_for_improvement": "The major areas for improvement are technical accuracy in describing the process and using correct terminology. The candidate needs a much deeper understanding of how to create and apply custom data validation rules, particularly for complex validation criteria like email addresses.

      "feedback": "The response is unfortunately too simplistic and inaccurate for this question. While mentioning the AVERAGE function is a start, it doesn't address the core challenge: calculating the average sales *per month* when there are multiple sales entries for each month.  Simply using AVERAGE won't group the data by month.  The answer lacks crucial detail on how to handle the multiple entries per month.",
      "suggestions": "To improve, the candidate should demonstrate knowledge of functions that can handle grouping and conditional calculations, such as SUMIFS and COUNTIFS, or pivot tables.  They should describe a process for extracting the monthly sales data, then using these functions to calculate the average for each month. Explaining the steps involved in a logical manner is key.  For example, they could discuss extracting the month from the date column using functions like MONTH, then using SUMIFS to sum sales for each month, and COUNTIFS to count the number of sales entries for each month.  Finally, they would divide the sums by the counts to get the average sales per month.  Alternatively, a pivot table approach would be a very strong and efficient solution.",
      "strengths": "The candidate correctly identified that an averaging function is needed. This shows some basic familiarity with Excel.",
      "areas_for_improvement": "The candidate needs to significantly improve their understanding of intermediate Excel functions and their application to data manipulation and analysis tasks.

  "overall_feedback": "Your overall performance shows a foundational understanding of some Excel features, particularly your recognition of relevant functions like VLOOKUP and the purpose of data validation. However, your technical accuracy and ability to clearly articulate solutions need significant improvement across all areas, especially in PivotTables and conditional formatting.  Focus on strengthening your practical application skills and mastering the precise terminology used in Excel functions and features.  With dedicated practice and focused learning, you can substantially improve your Excel proficiency.",
  "recommendations": [

    "Master INDEX/MATCH by working through tutorials and exercises that directly compare it to VLOOKUP. Focus on understanding the advantages of INDEX/MATCH, especially with non-contiguous lookup ranges and approximate matches.  Practice building complex formulas using INDEX/MATCH.",
    "Practice Data Validation extensively. Create several spreadsheets with different scenarios requiring various data validation types (e.g., dropdown lists, date ranges, whole numbers).  Experiment with error alerts and custom input messages.",
    "Dedicate time to mastering intermediate functions (SUMIF, AVERAGEIF, COUNTIFS).  Create a spreadsheet with sample data and challenge yourself to solve various problems using these functions.  Gradually increase the complexity of your formulas to improve your problem-solving skills."

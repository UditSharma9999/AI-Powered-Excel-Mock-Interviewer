      "feedback": "The response is far too vague and incomplete. While 'drag and drop' (referring to autofill) *can* be part of the solution, it doesn't explain the core process.  The answer lacks any mention of the `SUM` function, which is the most efficient and standard way to calculate totals in Excel for this scenario.  It's crucial to explain the steps clearly and completely.",
      "suggestions": "Instead of just saying 'drag and drop', describe the process step-by-step. For example:  'First, I would use the SUM function to calculate the total sales for Product A by selecting the cells containing the daily sales and entering the formula `=SUM(B2:G2)` (assuming sales for Product A are in cells B2 to G2). Then, I would use the autofill handle to drag the formula down to calculate the totals for Products B and C.'  Explain your assumptions about the data layout (row/column headings).  Illustrate your understanding of the core Excel functions.",

      "areas_for_improvement": "The response lacks depth and precision.  The candidate needs to demonstrate a clear understanding of the `SUM` function and how to apply it correctly.  They need to practice explaining their problem-solving approach systematically and comprehensively.",

This is a crucial skill for any Excel user, and this answer demonstrates a significant gap in your skillset.  We need to explore the reasons behind this lack of knowledge and work on building this fundamental skill.",
      "suggestions": "I recommend you start with basic Excel tutorials focusing on data visualization and chart creation.  There are many free resources available online, such as YouTube tutorials, Microsoft's own documentation, and online courses.  Focus on understanding the steps involved in selecting data, choosing the appropriate chart type, and customizing the chart for clarity. Practice creating different types of charts with sample data to build your confidence and proficiency.",

      "suggestions": "Practice using basic Excel functions like AVERAGE, SUM, and COUNT. Work through some example datasets to build familiarity.  Consider online tutorials or practice exercises to improve your skills.

      "feedback": "The response is incorrect.  There's no 'reven' function in Excel for highlighting negative numbers.  The question was about formatting cells to visually distinguish positive and negative values, not about performing calculations.  You need to understand how to use Excel's built-in formatting options.",
      "suggestions": "Review Excel's number formatting options.  Specifically, look at how to use custom number formats to apply different colors or styles to positive and negative numbers.  Practice this with sample data to solidify your understanding.",
      "strengths": "The candidate attempted to answer the question, showing some initiative.",
      "areas_for_improvement": "The candidate needs to significantly improve their knowledge of basic Excel formatting. They should focus on mastering the use of the 'Number' formatting options within the 'Home' tab of the Excel ribbon.  They should also work on accurately recalling and applying the correct Excel function names.",

  "overall_feedback": "Your overall performance indicates a need for foundational Excel training. While you showed some familiarity with autofill and demonstrated initiative in attempting all questions, your understanding of core functions like SUM and AVERAGE, chart creation, and basic formatting needs significant improvement.  Focus on mastering these fundamentals, and with dedicated practice, you'll see considerable progress.",
  "recommendations": [
    "Complete an online Excel tutorial focusing on basic formulas (SUM, AVERAGE) and cell formatting.  Many free resources are available on sites like YouTube (search for 'Excel basics tutorial') or Microsoft's own learning portal.",
    "Practice creating charts using sample datasets.  Start with simple data (e.g., monthly sales figures) and create bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs.  Focus on correctly labeling axes and titles.",
    "Work through a beginner-level Excel workbook exercise.  Many free workbooks are available online; search for 'Excel practice workbook beginner'.  These often provide step-by-step instructions and solutions.",
    "Find a small, real-world dataset (e.g., personal expenses, book collection) and practice applying SUM, AVERAGE, and cell formatting techniques.  This will help solidify your understanding and build confidence.",
    "Consider using online interactive Excel training platforms. These offer hands-on practice and immediate feedback, allowing you to learn at your own pace and address weaknesses directly."
